<ul>
<li>Section 2: Emotion in speech
<ul>
<li>Emotion cannot be easily seen from the waveform. At the most, a large amplitude could indicate someone shouting, but in general the waveform does not provide any information on emotion.</li>
<li>Although one cannot directly identify the emotion in a spectrogram, comparing the spectrograms of the different emotions will show some differences between the pitch contours:
<ul>
<li>lower pitch or descending pitch -&gt; sadness</li>
<li>higher formants -&gt; happiness</li>
<li>more fluctuating or higher pitch -&gt; happiness</li>
<li>flat pitch -&gt; neutral or angry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You might have seen that pitch contours are not always the same for the same emotion for different words</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 3: Splicing words
<ul>
<li>Splicing the word 'blow' from 'slow' and 'boat' results in a version of 'blow' that should sound quite natural. This is because it is fairly easy to cut the fricative 's' and plosive 'b' from speech as these phonemes are fairly clearly delineated in the speech signal, and do not have a lot of co-articulation (see lecture 2).</li>
<li>Splicing the word 'fond' from 'fork' and 'bend' will likely result in a version of 'fond' that sounds a bit odd/not natural. This is because the /O/ in 'fork' is "coloured" by the subsequent /r/, while in natural speech the /O/ will be slightly nasalised due to the upcoming /n/ in 'fond'. In other words, the vowel /O/ carries the wrong co-articulation features. This leads to the final spliced result sounding strange.</li>
<li>Moreover, you should have realised that for phonemes that are not fricatives and plosives, it is hard to cut the phoneme from the running speech. You might also have realised that it is hard to understand which sound it is from just a short snippet of the speech file.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 4: Analyzing formants
<ul>
<li>You should have seen that the values for F1 and F2 are different for the three instances of the&nbsp;<em>same</em> vowel in the three different words. This is because speech is highly variable, and thus the same word/phoneme/etc. will not sound the same each time it is spoken. Nevertheless, the vowels are "perceived" as the same.</li>
<li>You should have seen that the values for F1 and F2 are different for the two <em>different </em>vowels, and that the range of the formant values for F1 and F2 between vowels is larger than those within the same vowel and that the numerical values for both F1 and F2 are different between the /o/ and /e/, with higher F1 for /o/ and a higher F2 for /e/.</li>
<li>So some variation in formant values does not lead to a difference in perception, while other variation does.</li>
<li>It's much harder to distinguish between the vowels based on the spectrograms alone (visually).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section 5: Analyzing pitch
<ul>
<li>You should have observed that the pitch is different for the two versions of 'separate', with pitch ending higher for the question.</li>
<li>You should also recognize that unvoiced sounds do not have pitch, shown by the "missing" parts in the blue line. In this example, /p/ and /t/ are unvoiced, meaning they do not have a pitch as they are articulated without vibration of the vocal cords. This explains why the pitch is intermittent.</li>
<li>You should have noticed that emotion is (at least partially) conveyed through pitch.</li>
</ul>
